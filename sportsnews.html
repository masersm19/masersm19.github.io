<p>Championship hopes were nearly dashed when Bryce Young left the field in the second quarter against Arkansas. The shoulder injury -- and Young's reaction to it -- didn't look good. And while Jalen Milroe acquitted himself well in Young's absence, the fact that Young returned in full uniform and not in a sling or in street clothes was promising. With Texas A&M coming to town this week, a healthy Young would go a long way toward avenging last season's loss in College Station. Coach Kirby Smart is never going to apologize for a win, especially a road win in the SEC. But Smart wants to see his Dawgs playing cleaner football with fewer mistakes and finishing drives on offense. Georgia played just well enough to win Saturday in rallying past Missouri for a 26-22 victory. Some of the sloppiness the Dawgs have exhibited the past two weeks may catch up to them, although the schedule the next couple of weeks doesn't look too demanding. They have back-to-back home games against Auburn and Vanderbilt (ESPN)</p>

<p>	Baltimore could easily be 4-0 after four weeks. Instead the Ravens sit at 2-2 and blew two huge leads in the fourth quarter -- at home no less.

Sunday was inexcusable as Lamar Jackson threw two fourth-quarter interceptions and John Harbaugh decided to go for it on fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line in a tie game late in the fourth quarter. The result was Jackson's second interception of the game, which led to the Bills using the final 4:09 for Josh Allen to drive them down the field and lead them to victory. What Cooper Rush has done in his three starts is impressive, but the three teams the Cowboys have beaten in his starts are a combined 6-6. The Commanders and Giants don't appear to be powers, even if the Bengals win is looking better by the week.

Dallas has one of the best defensive lines in football, the real driving force behind the Cowboys' success over the past three weeks. Rush will face his biggest test facing the Rams and Eagles defenses over the next two weeks, a much tougher test than what he's seen against Washington and New York. No contest here. Kansas City dismantled a Tampa Bay defense that shut down its competition all season, using patrick mahomes and his brilliance to score 41 points off the Buccaneers. The Chiefs thought Tampa Bay had the best defense in the league, yet ran for 189 yards and Mahomes was hit only six times.

The Chiefs lost last week to the Colts because of mistakes, uncharacteristic of an Andy Reid team. The Buffalo Bills are definitely in this conversation, but the Chiefs have Mahomes and Reid. That puts Kansas City over the edge (NFL) </p>
